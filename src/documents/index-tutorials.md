These tutorials provide step-by-step instructions for customizing the First Discovery Tool.

These tutorials assumes that

* you are already familiar with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and
* you have tried the First Discovery Tool
[demo](http://build.fluidproject.org/first-discovery/demos/),
and are familiar with how it functions from a user perspective.

The First Discovery Tool is built using Infusion’s
[Preferences Framework](http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/PreferencesFramework.html).
Understanding [Infusion](http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/UnderstandingInfusionComponents.html)
and the Preferences Framework will help you, but you should still be able to
follow this tutorial and make basic customizations to the First Discovery Tool
even if you aren’t familiar with them.

**Note:** This tutorial does _not_ explain how to build a First Discovery Tool.
It explains how to work with the existing code to modify the tool.
