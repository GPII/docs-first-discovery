The First Discovery Tool is a
[Preferences Editor](http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/PreferencesEditor.html)
designed to be an entry point for users
who are new to customizing a user interface to match their own needs and preferences.
Its goal is to introduce users to some of the interface features that can be customized,
and to allow users to explore those features to discover their own personal preferences.

The First Discovery Tool is a JavaScript-based application, built using the
[Infusion](http://fluidproject.org/infusion.html)
[Preferences Framework](http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/PreferencesFramework.html).
Its architecure
(described in detail in this [architecture report](https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/First+Discovery+Tool+Architecture))
supports reskinning and customization by integrators.

This website provides documentation for developers wishing to
customize or extend the First Discovery Tool.
