One of the options that can be provided to Infusion components is a set of CSS-based
selectors identifying where in the DOM different elements can be found. Components use a
[DOM Binder](http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/DOMBinder.html) to access the
named elements.

The value for the `selectors` option is itself a Javascript object containing name/value pairs:

```javascript
selectors: {
    selector1Name: "selector 1 string",
    selector2Name: "selector 2 string",
      ...
}
```
